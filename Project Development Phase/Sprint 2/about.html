		<p><b>What is plasma in blood?</b></p>
         <ul>
         	<li>Plasma is the liquid portion of blood. About 55% of our blood is plasma, and the remaining 45% are red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets that are suspended in the plasma.</li>

             <li>Plasma is about 92% water. It also contains 7% vital proteins such as albumin, gamma globulin and anti-hemophilic factor, and 1% mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones and vitamins.</li>
         </ul>
           <b> Plasma serves four important functions in our body:</b>
             <ol>
             	<li>Helps maintain blood pressure and volume.</li>
   			    <li>Supply critical proteins for blood clotting and immunity.</li>
				 <li>Carries electrolytes such as sodium and potassium to our muscles.</li>
				 <li>Helps to maintain a proper pH balance in the body, which supports cell function.</li>
             </ol>
          <b>What is blood plasma used for?</b>
             <p>Plasma is commonly given to trauma, burn and shock patients, as well as people with severe liver disease or multiple clotting factor deficiencies. It helps boost the patient’s blood volume, which can prevent shock, and helps with blood clotting. Pharmaceutical companies use plasma to make treatments for conditions such as immune deficiencies and bleeding disorders.</p>

          <b>What is a plasma donation?</b>
				<p>	In a plasma-only donation, the liquid portion of the donor’s blood is separated from the cells. Blood is drawn from one arm and sent through a high-tech machine that collects the plasma. The donor’s red blood cells and platelets are then returned to the donor along with some saline. The process is safe and only takes a few minutes longer than donating whole blood.Donated plasma is frozen within 24 hours of being donated to preserve its valuable clotting factors. It can be stored for up to one year and thawed for transfusion to a patient when needed. Red Cross donations are often used directly for hospital patient transfusions, rather than pharmaceutical uses.
			    </p>
          <b>Am I eligible to donate plasma?</b>
                 <p>Not everyone is eligible to donate blood or plasma.</p>

 				<p>Here are the most common factors that may disqualify you from donating your plasma:</p>
                <ul>
                	<li><b>Illness.</b><p> People who have a fever, productive cough, or are feeling generally unwell shouldn’t donate. This also applies to people who are currently receiving antibiotics for active infections.</p></li>
                	<li><b>Medical conditions.</b><p> There are 23 conditions that the American Red Cross considers when screening blood donors. Certain chronic illnesses, such as hepatitis and HIV, automatically disqualify someone from donating. Other active conditions, such as tuberculosis, must be treated first for a certain amount of time before an individual can donate blood or plasma.</p></li>
					<li><b>Low iron.</b><p> Low iron or hemoglobin levels often disqualify someone from being able to donate whole blood or platelets. But since plasma donation doesn’t remove blood cells, you may still be able to donate plasma even with lower iron levels.</p></li>
               		<li> <b>Medications.</b><p> Certain medical treatments and procedures, such as blood transfusions and surgeries, may affect whether someone can donate plasma or not. Ask your doctor before donating plasma if you’re currently undergoing treatment for an illness.</p></li>
                   <li> <b>Travel.</b><p> People who have traveled to certain areas of the world may be more likely to be infected with a disqualifying illness, such as the Ebola or Zika virus.</p></li>
