PROBLEM STATEMENT :
              -->During the COVID 19 crisis, the requirement of plasma became a high priority and the donor count has become low.
              
              
              -->Saving the donor information and helping the needy by displaying the current donors list, would be a helping hand. 
              -->In regard to the problem faced, an application is to be built which would take the donor details, store them and display the availability of donors.
              -->The user interacts with the application.Registers by giving the details as a donor.
              -->The database will have all the details and if a user posts a request then the concerned blood group donors will get notified about it.
              -->This Application will collect the details of donors and make sure that in case of need, the blood will be made available to the patient.
              -->It aims to create an information about the donor and patients that are related to donating and receiving the blood. 
              -->The Proposed system will be used in Blood banks, both private and public hospitals .
              
FUTURE SCOPE  :
              In the future, there will be development for the system by adding several extra features such as
              -->Upgrading the UI that is more user-friendly which will help many users to access the website and also ensures 
                 that many plasma donors can be added into the community. 
              -->Using elastic load balancer, it helps to handle multiple requests at the same time which will maintain 
                 the uptime of the website with negligible downtime
